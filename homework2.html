<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Image 1</h2>

  <p>I chose this image because it shows the everyday life of New York. Displaying its city like feel with tons of cars and tall buildings. I chose to display this image this way because it displays a more night life version of New York evcn though the original image is during the day. I changed the hue of the image to display this effect. Allowing for a more dark and less vibrant show of the image.</p>
