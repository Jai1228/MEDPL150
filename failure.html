<h1>
As you leave the room your teammates notice.
  As per the rules they follow along.
  All with sadness on your faces. You guys walk out the door together.
  While leaving, you hear everyone celebrating. All of you recognize that they passed.
  Your teacher tells you how they passed and anger fills all of your faces. Especially yours, knowing you could've
  put more trust in ur teammates, no your friends.
