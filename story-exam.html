  <h1>The Written Exam</h1>


  <h1>
    You sit in a vast room filled with silent shinobi.
    The Last question makes no sense compared to the others. 
    The proctor tells you all if you would like to take the last question to stay,
    if not you may leave and retake it again next year.
    Hwoever, if one of your group members choose to leave,
    then the whole group must leave.
    You realize immediately: this exam isn’t about rihht or wrong answers. 
    But your ability to make circumstances work and trust in your team members.
  </h1>

  <h2> <strong>What do you do?</strong> </h2>

  <a href="confidence.html"><h2>Yell out - I refuse to leave! No way!</h2></a><br>
  <a href="sacrafice.html"><h2>Take the fall for your teammates because they aren't as confident as you.</h2></a>
