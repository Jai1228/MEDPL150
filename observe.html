<h1>Watching Eyes</h1>

<p>
You scan the room. Proctors move like shadows.
A teammate coughs twice — a signal.
A stranger tilts their paper slightly.
</p>

<a href="caught.html">Copy the stranger</a>

<h1>You Pass</h1>

<p>
You never answered a single question.
But you never broke.
The examiners smile.
</p>

<p><strong>You advance to the next stage.</strong></p>

<h1>Betrayed</h1>

<p>
The teammate you trusted sold you out to save themselves.
Confidence shatters.
Your exam ends early.

<h1>You Walk Away</h1>

<p>
Fear wins.
You convince yourself you’re not ready.
The door closes quietly behind you.
