  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>I created two photomontages in Photoshop that explore the relationship between nature, modern life, and digital isolation. 
   The first image shows a calm, modern living room with a lush rainforest and two colorful macaws visible through the window. 
   This contrast highlights how nature is often blocked out or forgotten in city life. By placing a wild, vibrant scene right outside the window, 
   the image suggests that even though nature still exists, it’s often unseen or ignored in urban environments.
   It reflects how society has separated itself from the natural world.

  The second montage focuses on digital isolation. 
   A person’s silhouette is surrounded by glowing computer screens and streams of binary code, creating a cold and overwhelming atmosphere. 
   This piece represents how technology can disconnect us from the real world and even from ourselves. I used Photoshop tools like layer masks, 
   brightness/contrast adjustments, and image blending to combine the elements. 
   All images used were either taken from public domain or royalty-free sources. 
   Both compositions use contrast, depth, and symbolism to reflect modern life’s imbalance with both nature and technology.</p>
