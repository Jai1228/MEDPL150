<h1>Jaiden Taveras</h1>

<p>I’m Jaiden, an artist from New York with a growing passion for animation and 3D design. 
I’ve always been into creative storytelling, whether it’s sketching characters, thinking up new worlds, or just messing around with visual ideas. 
I’ve realized that animation and 3D art are the perfect ways for me to bring those ideas to life.
Growing up in New York, I’ve been surrounded by all kinds of art and culture. 
There’s always something new happening here, and that constant creative energy has definitely shaped the way I see and make things. 
What really excites me now is diving deeper into the 3D world learning the tools, animating characters, 
and figuring out how to make things move and feel real.</p>
