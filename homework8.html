  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>When creating my blinking eye I didnt go for the realistic look I wanted it to look more like old cartoon style. Instead of showing the upper eyelid closing.
    I decided to get rid of it to show the blinking effect and then adding it back as if the eye was opening again. I decided to use a recent image of my little brother's first Halloween.
  He was dressed as Buzzlight year.  I used this image to move him side to side to make him look as if he was flying.</p>
