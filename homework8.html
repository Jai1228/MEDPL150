  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>When creating my blinking eye I didnt go for the realistic look I wanted it to look more like old cartoon style. Instead of showing the upper eyelid closing.
    I decided to get rid of it to show the blinking effect and then adding it back as if the eye was opening again. I decided to use Naruto for my puppet animation. 
  He is my favorite anime character. I made him move side to side as if he was going to use the rasengan(blue energy ball) in his left hand. </p>
