  <h3>Reflection</h3>
 <p>I started with a photo of a busy city street and changed it into a more graphic, colorful version. 
   I used only three colors — green (#4CAF50), orange (#FF9800), and violet (#9C27B0) — to give the image a bold and creative look. 
   I kept the people in their natural colors so the scene still felt real, but I changed the buildings, street, and sky to flat, 
   solid colors to make it look like an illustration. Then, I added a geometric shape in the sky to make the image more interesting 
   and to show how shapes can change the balance of a design. </p>
