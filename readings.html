  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>In her essay “In Plato’s Cave,” Susan Sontag talks about how photography shapes the way we see the world. She compares photographs to shadows in Plato’s cave images that seem real, but are only reflections. This idea helped me understand that a photo doesn’t show the full truth. Instead, it shows only a small part of a moment, chosen by the photographer.

Sontag explains that taking photos gives people a feeling of control over what they do. When someone takes a photo, they are capturing a moment and keeping it for themselves. This made me think about how people today use phones to take pictures all the time on trips, at events, or even of their food. I feel like as a society don’t feel we’ve really experienced something unless we’ve taken a picture of it. I’ve done this too, and now I wonder if I’m sometimes more focused on taking the photo than enjoying the moment.

Another idea that stood out to me was how photos can make people feel distant from what they’re seeing. Sontag says that when we see too many pictures—especially of sad or violent events—we can become numb. We might feel less emotion because we’ve seen so many similar images before. This reminded me of how often we see pictures of war, poverty, or disasters on the internet. It’s easy to scroll past them without thinking too deeply because we’re used to it. That’s a little scary because it means we might stop caring or stop taking action.

Sontag also talks about how photographers choose what to show. This means they also choose what not to show. Showing someone smiling doesn’t show if they were sad later, or what happened before or after the photo. It made me realize that just because we see something in a picture doesn’t mean we know the whole story. This is important to remember, where people only post what they want others to see. People tend to hide things they are insecure about, or things that others would find abnormaal. People tend to just post what society would accept instead of sharing things that they enjoy or follow.

What I liked most about this essay is that it made me think about photography in a different way. As someone interested in art and animation, I often use photos as references or take pictures to capture ideas. Now I understand that photos aren’t just tools or memories—they also have power. They can shape how people think and feel. They can even change what we believe is true.

In the end, Sontag doesn’t say photography is bad, but she wants us to be more aware. We need to think critically about the pictures we take and the ones we see. I think that’s an important message, especially today when we are surrounded by images all the time. After reading this, I want to pay more attention to how I use photography in my work and in my everyday life.</p>
