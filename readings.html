  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>In her essay “In Plato’s Cave,” Susan Sontag talks about how photography shapes the way we see the world. She compares photographs to shadows in Plato’s cave images that seem real, but are only reflections. This idea helped me understand that a photo doesn’t show the full truth. Instead, it shows only a small part of a moment, chosen by the photographer.

Sontag explains that taking photos gives people a feeling of control over what they do. When someone takes a photo, they are capturing a moment and keeping it for themselves. This made me think about how people today use phones to take pictures all the time on trips, at events, or even of their food. I feel like as a society don’t feel we’ve really experienced something unless we’ve taken a picture of it. I’ve done this too, and now I wonder if I’m sometimes more focused on taking the photo than enjoying the moment.

Another idea that stood out to me was how photos can make people feel distant from what they’re seeing. Sontag says that when we see too many pictures—especially of sad or violent events—we can become numb. We might feel less emotion because we’ve seen so many similar images before. This reminded me of how often we see pictures of war, poverty, or disasters on the internet. It’s easy to scroll past them without thinking too deeply because we’re used to it. That’s a little scary because it means we might stop caring or stop taking action.

Sontag also talks about how photographers choose what to show. This means they also choose what not to show. Showing someone smiling doesn’t show if they were sad later, or what happened before or after the photo. It made me realize that just because we see something in a picture doesn’t mean we know the whole story. This is important to remember, where people only post what they want others to see. People tend to hide things they are insecure about, or things that others would find abnormaal. People tend to just post what society would accept instead of sharing things that they enjoy or follow.

What I liked most about this essay is that it made me think about photography in a different way. As someone interested in art and animation, I often use photos as references or take pictures to capture ideas. Now I understand that photos aren’t just tools or memories—they also have power. They can shape how people think and feel. They can even change what we believe is true.

In the end, Sontag doesn’t say photography is bad, but she wants us to be more aware. We need to think critically about the pictures we take and the ones we see. I think that’s an important message, especially today when we are surrounded by images all the time. After reading this, I want to pay more attention to how I use photography in my work and in my everyday life.</p>


 
  <h2> With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik.</h2>
  <p>In her article, Nesrine Malik explains how artificial intelligence is creating a serious problem online. 
    She uses the term “AI slop” to describe the huge amount of fake or low-quality content being made by AI and spread across the internet.
    This includes things like fake product reviews, AI-written news stories,
    images that look real but are made by a computer, and even deepfake videos. 
    She warns that this is not just annoying or confusing — it could become a big danger to how we understand truth.</p>
  <p>One of the strongest points she makes is that most people don’t realize how fast this is happening. 
    She says the world is “sleepwalking” into this problem, meaning we are not paying enough attention. 
    It’s easy to scroll through TikTok, Instagram, or news sites without noticing how much content is created by AI.
    If we can’t tell what’s real and what’s fake, it becomes hard to trust anything. 
    This can cause confusion, and even lead to bigger issues like false political information or fake news spreading quickly.</p>
  <p>This article really made me stop and think.
    I use the internet every day — for school, social media, and entertainment — and I never really thought about how much of the content I see might not be real.
    It’s scary to think that AI is making things that look completely believable, but could be completely false.
    Malik makes it clear that this is not just about silly filters or funny images, 
    but about how we make decisions and what we believe in.
    I also agree with her point that AI isn’t always bad. 
    It can be useful in many ways, like helping with research or making creative tools. 
    But the problem is when AI is used without care, and when no one checks what it produces. 
    If we keep letting AI flood the internet without any rules or responsibility, it will get harder and harder to find real, trustworthy information.</p>

  <h2>Al Jazeera’s Motherhood in Crisis: Chapter 4 – “My Punishment”</h2>
  <p>In Al Jazeera’s Motherhood in Crisis: Chapter 4 – “My Punishment”, the story uses drawings, photos, text, and video to show the lives of women in Sierra Leone who face punishment and shame during pregnancy. 
    The illustrations help share feelings and moments that are hard to show with only photos or words.
    The drawings look very different from the photographs.
    The illustrations use soft colours and simple lines. They do not show every detail but focus on emotions. 
    For example, a woman may be drawn sitting alone to show sadness or fear. The photos show real people and real places, giving the story truth and realism. 
    While photos capture what happened, drawings show how it felt.
  Illustration also helps tell parts of the story that could not be photographed.
    Some moments are private or painful, and using a camera might not be right. Drawings can show these scenes in a respectful and sensitive way, protecting the women’s identity while still sharing their experience.
  Compared to text alone, illustrations make the story more visual and emotional. They help the reader imagine the events and understand the feelings of the women. 
    Together with photos and text, the drawings make the story more powerful and human.</p>

  <H2> Relection #4</H2>
  <p> Reading the article provoked a sense of urgent caution. The authors argue that we are living through a renewed “nascence” of nuclear danger — not a relic of the Cold War, but a present-day crisis. The combination of modern, smaller-yield weapons (far more deadly than conventional arms),
    heightened geopolitical tension in multiple regions, and eroding international norms around nuclear restraint makes the possibility of nuclear use disturbingly plausible. 
What struck me most is the way the article reframes nuclear weapons not as abstract geopolitical chess pieces, but as existential risks — something that could instantly erase millions of lives and inflict long-term damage on the planet.
  This echoes other recent research pointing out that even a “limited” nuclear exchange could trigger unintended cascading consequences: global climate disruption, famine, long-term environmental harm. 
Reading this reminded me of short- but powerful exercises described by scholars: mapping out what a nuclear explosion would do to a city you know — the destruction of familiar neighborhoods,
    the loss of friends or family, the collapse of everyday life. That kind of stark, meaningful personal visualization seems crucial to truly understand what "nuclear war" would mean for ordinary people. 
It is also sobering to think of how fragile the old mechanisms that kept nuclear war at bay have become. Treaties and arms-control frameworks once offered a structure of predictability and deterrence. 
  But as trust between major powers frays, as weapons modernize, and as political brinkmanship becomes normalized, we may no longer be able to rely on those old safeguards to protect humanity. 
At the same time, the article — and the broader conversation it reflects — reminds me that prevention isn’t just about treaties or disarmament: it’s also about public awareness, political will, and social pressure. 
    People often treat nuclear weapons as too big, too remote — something only states worry about. But if nuclear war is even conceivable, everyone shares the risk. That makes activism, journalism, scientific transparency, and international cooperation essential.
The human cost would be unimaginable. Beyond the immediate blast and radiation — immense and horrific as that would be — there are longer-term effects: environmental collapse, famine, global destabilization. 
    The interdependence of nations and ecosystems means that no region would be immune. Survivors would face an unrecognizable world.
On a personal level, the article forced me to confront a difficult reality: despite decades of anti-nuclear advocacy, the danger never went away — and may now be rising. 
    It’s a sober reminder that just because we survived the Cold War doesn’t mean we’re safe forever. Innocence — as a generation or a society — can be false comfort.</p>
